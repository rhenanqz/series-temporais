        "\n# Understanding Harmonic Structures\nIn this tutorial, we will explore a seemingly basic question: in analysing\noscillatory waveforms, what is a harmonic? We will start with explaining\nnonsinusoidal shapes in terms of harmonics. Then we will define instantaneous\nfrequency and use it think about when two oscillations may be considered\nindependent as opposed to being harmonics. We will use this intuition to\nformally define harmonic structures. Spoiler: it's not as straightforward\nas you may think!\n\nThis tutorial accompanies the following paper which contains a more mathematical exposition of the topic and more detailed examples:\n\n    Fabus, M. S., Woolrich, M. W., Warnaby, C. W., & Quinn, A. J. (2021).\n    Understanding Harmonic Structures Through Instantaneous Frequency.

        "## Harmonics and nonsinusoidal signals\nIf you've ever heard of the term 'harmonic', your current definition probably\naligns well with that taken from Wikipedia: *A harmonic is a wave with a\nfrequency that is a positive integer multiple of the frequency of the\noriginal wave, known as the fundamental frequency*. Harmonics are important\nacross disciplines. We see them in Physics when solving partial differential\nequations, in Music when considering chords, and even in Neuroscience when we\nobserve nonsinusoidal oscillations `Cole & Voytek (2019) <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2016.12.008>`_.\n\nIt is the last case that we wish to elaborate. The first important concept is\nthat **nonsinusoidal waveforms have harmonics in their spectra**.\n\nLet's see this in action. We create a 10Hz square wave and look at its Fourier spectrum.\n\n"

Their presence can lead to misleading connectivity\nresults `Gerber et al.

        "## Formal Harmonic Conditions\nNow that we've seen how instantaneous frequency can distinguish between\nambiguous cases of summed signals, let's use it to formally define what\nharmonics are. We shall say that a resultant signal $x(t)$ formed as a\nsum of $N$ sinusoids ordered by increasing frequency, $x(t) =\n\\sum_{n=1}^N a_n \\cos(\\omega_n t + \\phi_n)$\n\n1. All sinusoids have an integer frequency relationship to the base and a constant phase relationship, i.e. $\\omega_n = n \\omega_0, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi_n}{\\mathrm{d}t}=0$.\n2. The joint instantaneous frequency $f_J$ for the resultant signal is well-defined for all $t$, i.e. $(f_J \\geq 0) \\forall t$.\n\nIn simple terms, the first condition guarantees the joint function retains\nthe same period as the base and the second condition makes sure we have no\nprominent secondary extrema. In theory, we now have a simple recipe for\nidentifying harmonics! In practice, more useful relationships can be derived\nfrom the above two conditions. For a full exposition, please see the\nmanuscript associated with this notebook.\n\nIt turns out the second condition also has a natural interpretation in terms\nof extrema counting and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). For two signals,\nit is equivalent to demanding $af\u22641$, where a and f are the amplitude and\nfrequency ratios of the signals respectively. For more involved discussion\nabout this, as well as an application to simulated and experimental\nneurophysiological data, check out the full paper.\n\n"
